With friends and colleagues at LSE, I co-founded the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/econphdamp/home" style="color:DarkBlue; text-decoration:none;">Applicant Mentoring Programme (AMP)</a>, a mentoring scheme for PhD applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.<br>
AMP is now a multi-university effort, led by Ph.D. students at Cambridge, LSE, Oxford, UCL and Warwick and supported financially by the department of Economics at LSE.<br><br>

Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/ArnaudDyevre/status/1590416758069809152" style="color:DarkBlue; text-decoration:none;">summary Twitter thread about AMP</a>.<br><br>

If you come from a socio-economic background that is underrepresented in the profession, and if you need some guidance about the Ph.D. application process in Economics, feel free to fill out the form in the website hyperlinked above. Subject to capacity constraints, you will be matched to a mentor who is a Ph.D. student in one of the 5 participating universities.
