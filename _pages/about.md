Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in economics at LSE, with interests in Macroeconomics and Public Economics.
 
In my research, I study the role of <a style="color:DarkBlue; text-decoration:none;">government-funded R&D in fueling growth</a>. I also have interests in <a style="color:DarkBlue; text-decoration:none;">firm heterogeneity</a> and <a style="color:DarkBlue; text-decoration:none;">production networks</a> that I study both theoretically and empirically.

I'm always happy to chat about research ideas and outreach initiatives in economics. 
Please get in touch if you would like to talk about either!
