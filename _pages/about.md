Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in economics at LSE, with interests in macroeconomics and public economics.
 
In my research, I study the role of **government-funded R&D in fueling growth**. I also investigate questions about **firm heterogeneity** and **production networks**, both theoretically and empirically.

<!-- I'm always happy to chat about research ideas and outreach initiatives in economics. 
Please get in touch if you would like to talk about either!
