This is the repository of my academic website: [arnauddyevre.com](arnauddyevre.com). 
In the process of building it, I found the following guides helpful, and others might too:
  - [Making sure one uses the right version of Ruby](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/the-definitive-guide-to-installing-ruby-gems-on-a-mac/)
  - Detailed step-by-step guides on how to deploy an academic website powered by Jekyll via GitHub: [Rob Williams](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/), [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/) and [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/)

It uses a Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License.
